            <h2>Experience Economy</h2>
            <p>Experience of using a product or service is increasingly becoming a key differentiator for businesses across most sectors.

            In the world where disruption is a norm ,barriers to entry difficult to achieve and commoditization is rampant, businesses are trying to hold on to customers by providing a delightful experience.

            Only 52 companies from the first Fortune 500 list published in 1955 still figure in 2021 list. While most of the new entrants are innovative disrupters , ones who have maintained their place have consolidated their position but establishing a memorable brand providing a great experience besides developing innovative products and services.

            Let us breakdown the various type of experiences.</p>

            <h2>Customer Experience (CX)</h2>
            <p>Customer Experience is a broad experience across the sale, marketing and support.

            Before the advent of internet engagement with customers were only Face to Face and over the telephone. Companies took pains to design the engagement plans with the right mix of human resources to optimize engagement. There was lot of innovation in telephone based engagement including technologies like interactive voice response, speech recognition and analytics which improved customer experience.

            Internet and development of World Wide Web created a huge shift in the way customer started engaging with business. It started with public websites providing predominantly text and image based information to the customer followed by exchanging relevant information instantly through electronic mails. This was a time businesses with less resources but a good product or services were able to use internet to inform and communicate with prospects relatively inexpensively resulting in increased competition and more expectations on the incumbents.

            The advent of Mobile phone provided a tool to deliver experience anywhere using voice and subsequently short message services . Fast forward a decade social networks came on the scene and provided customer additional tools to engage with businesses and the communities around the world about their experiences with the products and services.

            Today the customer has a plethora of ways to instantly engage with the businesses across multiple channels long before they even make the purchase and throughout the lifecycle of the relationship. At every stage of this engagement there is a very high expectation on their experience.

            Experience today is one of key factors for customer intention to buy, loyalty and willingness to recommend the product or service they use.</p>
          
            <h2>User Experience (UX)</h2>
            <p>User Experience has become more critical than ever with the rapid digitization of products and services .

            In the past user experience was an after though while designing a product or service. It was designed by group of people in a room who would work out how customer would use their product or service with very little input from the actual user.

            Today UX can make or break a product. Lot of work is done with actual users using Human Centered Design . Customer Journeys are iterated to make the experience seamless for different customer personas across the life cycle of the customer relationship. Key factors to improve experience e.g. speed, ease ,accuracy in the buying, support journeys are explored. A living and breathing feedback loop is put in place to measure and improve user experience.</p>
          
            <h2>Employee Experience (EX)</h2>
            <p>The industrial revolution led to major focus on efficiency since it had a huge impact on output. Humans were a essential part of this system and to ensure a predictive human output a hierarchal management structure evolved where by the roles and responsibilities were rigid. Employee experience was not a big focus area in this era.

            We have a come a long way since and ways of working have evolved. While we still have a substantial industrial work which is more hybrid given the automation technologies, Knowledge work explosion has driven flatter management structures and in some cases in a relatively self-organized setting. Traditional people functions in businesses are now tasked with looking after the experience of the employees in the same way we do for customers.

            This has resulted in huge progress in tools and processes used for hiring, engagement, experience and lifetime management of employees.

            Today digital tools are used for onboarding, feedback, engagement, performance, rewarding and even offboarding across the lifecycle of employee’s time with the business.

            Some of the key factors critical to achieve delightful experiences.</p>
            
            <h2>Omni-Channel Engagement</h2>
                                
             <p>With the proliferation of channels of engagement paradoxically the experience doesn’t necessarily get better. Invariability there is loss of communication between channels which more often than not make the experience suffer.

            Omni-channel engagement streamlined with the relevant user, customer or employee journey becomes critical. While at the face of it this seems a easy task the operating model of most businesses are very disjoint making it hard to achieve.</p>
            
            <h2>Intelligent Workflows</h2>
             <p>Processes are core to any business transaction and companies have established processes to make the optimum use of resources to make the transactions efficient and seamless.

            Analogous to the customer journeys there are internal business workflows which are a combination of processes which result in a transaction completed in a most effective way. With AI,RPA and other automation technologies these workflows can be made more efficient with the right mix of human and machines to complete the transaction.

            Intelligent Workflows are helping traditional businesses to be more competitive in today’s disruptive world.</p>

             <h2> <h2>Advanced Analytics</h2>
             <p>Business generates huge amount of data for every interaction within the business and with the customers. This data is structured and unstructured but has traditionally been only used for financial reporting and planning activities in a historical context.

            With easy availability of enormous computing power and latest analytics technologies this Data is now used to provide advance analytics to business . Businesses can also combine this data with other external data to provide predictive insights on business performance, competitive threats and opportunities and ways to enhance the product and services experience all in real-time.

            The economic impact of delivering a delightful experience in all contexts in today’s hyper-personalized world is enormous.

            We have long understood the value of experience as the Progression of Economic Value with companies like Disney, IBM and GE showing the way by the end of 20th century. Fast forward today’s pandemic driven economy businesses are re-imagining themselves through the lens of experiences delivered.

            KPMG in a report found striking the right balance between customer experience, customer expectation and value is critical and core to the principle of CX Economics.

            UX investments have been proven to increase usage which is a proxy for sales, cost savings by reduced developer time to fix hastily released products.

            Pandemic has reset the employee and employer relationship in a fundamental way. While new ways of working have become the talk of the day, there is a deeper change driven by redefining the key organizational imperatives of purpose, values and culture which drive changes in how companies operate and grow. EX is the key to understand and redefine this relationship.

            IBM report found that organizations that score in the top 25% on EX double return on sales and three times return on assets compared to the organizations in the bottom quartile.

            We are at a inflection point in the global economy with pandemic having a huge impact on way we work , do business and develop products and services. All aspects of the Experience economy has never been as important and will have a major role to play in future.</p>
