            <p>First two decades of this century have seen a phenomenal growth in the use of technology across all aspects of business and life.

               The Covid19 pandemic, likes of which has not been seen in more than a century, has further accelerated Digital Transformation of businesses and governments globally in the last two years. Exponential impact of this change will be seen in the coming years.

               Key technologies contributing to this enormous shift in 2022 and beyond</p>
            
            <h2>Cloud</h2>
            <p>Cloud services have already moved from renting of compute and storage capacity to delivering platform based services e.g. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning ( AI/ML) , Big Data ( Data Lakes ) , Internet of Things (IOT), Blockchain across industry verticals.

             We will see more Industry vertical based platforms and services in 2022 with hyperscale providers ( Amazon, Microsoft and Google ) trying to differentiate themselves in increasingly commoditized market.

             SaaS Marketplaces growth on hyperscale platforms will accelerate, making them a leading channel to market for SaaS companies. Traditional application service providers will pivot further to managing applications in the cloud with dwindling application development and system integration revenue.

             Multi-cloud and Hybrid-cloud solutions adoption will steadily increase in 2022 as preventing vendor lock in , retain flexibility and control and best of breed approach increases in importance especially for pre-cloud companies.</p>
             
            <h2>Edge</h2>
             <p>Edge computing has moved from early days of streamlining content delivery to mainstream business use cases , due to explosion of data generated by businesses in industrial shop floors, retail shops, branch sites.

             The limitation in moving and processing this data centrally in Data Centers or Public Cloud within acceptable timeframes and costs, hampers business decision making and competitiveness.

             Edge computing in 2022 will be driven by rapid deployment of Internet of Things (IOT) infrastructure, Smart devices, Wearables and rise of Autonomous vehicles, AR/VR devices and gaming use cases.</p>
            
            <h2>Automation</h2>
            <p>Remote work using digital tools and workflows has accelerated the need for businesses to streamline old processes and in many cases to adopt modern processes ,which lend themselves to use of automation technologies.

            Automation of workflows across front and back offices will explode in 2022 . Key areas of growth in Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Cognitive Automation using AI/ML across industries will multiply as businesses compete in the post-pandemic world.</p>

            <h2>5G</h2>
            <p>A ubiquitous real-time economy promise of 5G wireless technology is an exciting development for businesses. Earlier wireless technologies have revolutionized the consumer applications and devices but have not been fit for purpose for running critical business applications.

            This will change with 5G services with upwards of 10x increase from 4G data throughput , ultra low latency of less than 1 millisecond and five nines reliability.

            5G will drive enterprise level use cases especially for Manufacturing, Healthcare, Smart Cities e.g. Autonomous Vehicles, Remote Surgeries, Smart factories, Immersive reality (AR/VR/Mixed) besides gaming and entertainment.

            Private 5G networks will be a area to watch giving domain experts providers flexibility to put together solutions while mobile service providers enable their technology stacks to address enterprise market.</p>
            <h2>IOT</h2>
            <p>Internet connected things will increase exponentially due to advances in connectivity options, rapid development of inexpensive sensors, multi-edge and cloud management software and myriad data and insight management platforms reducing time to value.

            In 2022 we should see maturing of leading use cases of Vehicle Fleet Management, Asset Monitoring and Tracking, Process Automation, Predictive Maintenance and Smart Cites ( e.g. Connected utilities, Parking Meters, Traffic Lights) with new edge analytics solutions.

            There will be rapid adoption in Covid-19 related use cases in Healthcare (e.g. In-home patient monitoring, Vaccine Transportation, Remote Testing ) and Supply Chain ( e.g. inventory tracking, environmental tracking, predictive forecasting and advanced robotics and analytics ).</p>
            <h2>Blockchain</h2>
            <p>Blockchain is one of the most exciting technologies with a lot of long term potential. Bitcoin is still the biggest blockchain based crypto currency which over the last decade has reached market capitalization of close to US$1T and would be globally seventh largest enterprise if it was a company. NFT’s have been the story of 2021 with $15 Billion turnover across all blockchain platforms.

            NFT use cases in 2022 should move from the attention grabbing Digital art virtual ownership to broader market of physical assets like Real-life Paintings, Land and even houses with possibilities of fractional ownership.

            The biggest trend to watch in 2022 is the rise of Web 3.0 technologies(WEB3). Blockchain is the fundamental building block of WEB3 which endeavors to build the new internet from ground up , giving users full control of their own data and make web decentralized and more secure.

            This is in response to WEB 2.0 (which refers the current generation of internet) driven by user created content but controlled a few globally centralized entities.

            WEB3 development projects are increasingly using a unique organizational model concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) . DAOs don’t have a traditional organizational structure and governance but are self organized using blockchain based smart contracts for governance. Participants make investments using tokens which gives them equity in the project and work in a decentralized manner.</p>
