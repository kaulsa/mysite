            <p>The rapid progress made by Large Language Models (LLM) e.g., ChatGPT in recent times has rekindled the debate on when and if the AI tools will achieve parity with human intelligence (commonly known as Artificial General Intelligence AGI).

            To understand the context, let us define human intelligence and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
            
            <h2>Definitions</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence is set of tools developed by humans using software-based algorithms which make predictions. These tools have inbuilt methods of learning and use complex statistical methods. Below diagram breaks down the key components of AI.
           
            Human intelligence on the other hand is complex and stems from the consciousness or sentience, which is fundamental to any biological intelligence. It has self-perception and awareness by which it relates to the world around them. 
            
            Below diagram explains the levels of consciousness.More than six decades of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and applications has not taken us any closer to the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). 
            
            There is consensus about the conscious being the main reason for lack of progress often called the ‘hard problem of consciousness’ ( DJ Chalmers )
            
            I came across the chart on Twitter (don’t have a way of verifying the data) (more charts here https://bit.ly/3owJsoi  ) but this set me thinking on how far we are from achieving AGI.</p>
             
            <h2>Can Machines think?</h2>
             <p>Human mind over centuries has created machines, using human intelligence, industrialization needed human to augment the operations of these machines on efficient assembly lines. With evolution humans have created better machines which can do more complex tasks providing more time humans to engage on higher order thinking.

            With the advances in computing infrastructure humans have been able to develop AI systems which can mimic some of the prediction, pattern matching and learning methods. These decisions still need to augmented by humans, especially where it is life threatening or financial or social implications.</p>
            
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>Remote work using digital tools and workflows has accelerated the need for businesses to streamline old processes and in many cases to adopt modern processes ,which lend themselves to use of automation technologies.

            Automation of workflows across front and back offices will explode in 2022 . Key areas of growth in Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Cognitive Automation using AI/ML across industries will multiply as businesses compete in the post-pandemic world.</p>
